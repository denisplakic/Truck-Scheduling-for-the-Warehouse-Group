    ''' Solves a vehicle routing problem given some routes and costs

        Parameters:
        -----------
        routes_input : array-like
            Stores the nodes visited by each route and the cost of each
        Saturday : bool (optional)
            Removes some constraints for solving problem on Saturdays - since no demand at some stores

        Returns:
        --------
        best_routes : vector
            The routes which give the lowest total travel time
        cost : float
            The minimum travel time for these routes


        Notes:
        ------
        routes_input must have each route as a row of 1's and 0's.
        The second-to-last column must contain the cost of the routes.
        The final column contains the supply information - true for north supply,
        false for south supply.
        Saturday should be set to true to exclude Noel Leeming stores on Saturdays 
        from solution.
